\chapter{Statistical thinking for programmers}

This book is about turning data into knowledge.  Data is cheap (at
least relatively); knowledge is harder to come by.

I will present three related pieces:

\begin{description}

\item[Probability] is the study of random events.  Most people have an
  intuitive understanding of degrees of probability, which is why we
  can use words like ``probably'' and ``unlikely'' without special
  training, but we will talk about how to make quantitative claims
  about those degrees.

\item[Statistics] is the discipline of using data samples to support
  claims about populations.  Most statistical analysis is based on
  probability, which is why these pieces are usually presented
  together.

\item[Computation] is a tool that is well-suited to quantitative
  analysis, and computers are commonly used to process statistics.
  Also (and more importantly for this book) computational experiments
  are useful for exploring concepts in probability and statistics.

\end{description}

The thesis of this book is that if you know how to program, you can
use that skill to help you understand probability and statistics.
These topics are often presented from a mathematical perspective, and
that approach works well for some people.  But some important ideas
in this area are hard to work with mathematically and relatively
easy to approach computationally.

Both approaches have merits, and the ideal might combine both, but
the goal of this book is to explore the computational path.

The rest of this chapter presents a case study motivated by a question
I heard when my wife and I were expecting our first child: do first
babies tend to arrive late?

\section{Do first babies arrive late?}

If you Google this question, you will find plenty of discussion.
Some people claim it's true, others say it's a myth, and some people
say it's the other way around: first babies come early.

In many of these discussions, people provide data to support their
claims.  I found many examples like these:

\begin{quote}

``My two friends that have given birth recently to their first babies,
BOTH went almost 2 weeks overdue before going into labour or being
induced.''

``My first one came 2 weeks late and now I think the second one is
going to come out two weeks early!!''

``I don't think that can be true because my sister was my mother's
first and she was early, as with many of my cousins.''

\end{quote}

Reports like these are called {\bf anecdotal evidence} because they
are based on data that is unpublished and usually personal.  In casual
conversation, there is nothing wrong with anecdotes, so I don't mean
to pick on the people I quoted.

But we might want evidence that is more persuasive and
an answer that is more reliable.  By those standards, anecdotal
evidence usually fails, because:

\begin{description}

\item[Small number of observations:] If the gestation period is longer
  for first babies, the difference is probably small compared to the
  natural variation.  In that case, we might have to compare a large
  number of pregnancies to be sure there is really a difference (or
  not).

\item[Selection bias:] People who join a discussion of this question
  might be interested because their first babies were late.  In that
  case the process of selecting data would bias the results.

\item[Confirmation bias:] People who believe the claim might be more
  likely to contribute examples that confirm it.  People who doubt the
  claim are more likely to cite counterexamples.

\item[Inaccuracy:] Anecotes are often personal stories that are
  (deliberately or not) misremembered, misrepresented, repeated
  inaccurately, etc.

\end{description}

So how can we do better?

\section{A statistical approach}

To address the limitations of anecdotes, we will use the tools
of statistics, which include:

\begin{description}

\item[Data collection:] We will use data from a large national survey
  that was designed explicitly with the goal of generating
  statistically valid inferences about the U.S. population.

\item[Descriptive statistics:] We will generate statistics that
  summarize the data concisely, and evaluate different ways to
  visualize data.

\item[Exploratory data analysis:] We will examine the data looking for
  patterns, differences, and other features that address the questions
  we are interested in.  At the same time we will check for
  inconsistencies and identify limitations.

\item[Hypothesis testing:] Where we see apparent effects (like a
  difference between two groups), we will evaluate whether the effect
  is likely to be real, or whether it might have happened by chance.

\item[Estimation:] We will use measurements in the dataset to estimate
  characteristics of the general population.

\end{description}

By performing these steps with care to avoid common pitfalls, we can
reach conclusions that are more justifiable and more likely to be
correct.


\section{The National Survey of Family Growth}

Since 1973 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
have conducted the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG),
which is intended to gather ``information on family life, marriage and
divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and
women's health. The survey results are used ... to plan health services and
health education programs, and to do statistical studies of families,
fertility, and health.''\footnote{See
  \url{cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm}.}

We will use data collected by this survey to investigate whether first
babies tend to come late, and other questions.  In order to use this
data effectively, we have to understand the design of the study.

The NSFG is a {\bf cross-sectional} study, which means that it
captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time.  The most
common alternative is a {\bf longitudinal} study, which observes a
group repeatedly over a period of time.

The NSFG has been conducted seven times; each deployment is called
a {\bf cycle}.  We will be using data from Cycle 6, which was
conducted from January 2002 to March 2003.

The goal of the survey is to draw conclusions about a
{\bf population}; the target population of the NSFG is people in
the United States aged 15-44.

The people who participate in a survey are called {\bf respondents}.
In general, cross-sectional studies are meant to be {\bf
  representative}, which means that every member of the target
population has an equal chance of participating.  Of course that ideal
is hard to achieve in practice, but people who conduct surveys come as
close as they can.

The NSFG not representative; instead it is deliberately {\bf
  oversampled}.  The designers of the study recruited three
groups---Hispanics, African-Americans and teenagers---at rates higher
than their representation in the U.S. population.
The reason for oversampling is to make sure that the number of
respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw valid
statistical inferences.

Of course, the drawback of oversampling is that it is not as easy
to draw conclusions about the general population based on statistics
from the survey.  We will come back to this point later.

\begin{ex}

Although the NSFG has been conducted seven times, it is not a
longitudinal study.  Read the Wikipedia pages
\url{wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study}
and
\url{wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study}
to make sure you understand why not.

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}

In this exercise, you will download data from the NSFG and do some
exploratory data analysis.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Go to \url{thinkstatsbook.com/nsfg.html}.  Read the terms of
use for this data and click ``I accept these terms'' (assuming that you do).

\item Download the files named {\tt 2002FemResp.dat.gz} and {\tt
  2002FemPreg.dat.gz}.  The first is the respondent file, which contains
  one line for each of the 7,643 female respondents.
  The second file contains one line for each pregnancy reported by a
  respondent.

\item Online documentation of the survey is at
  \url{nsfg.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/WebDocs/NSFG/public/index.htm}.
  Browse the sections in the left navigation bar to get a sense of
  what data are included.  You can also read the questionnaires
  at \url{cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/nsfg_2002_questionnaires.htm}.

\item The web page for this book provides code to process the data
  files from the NSFG.  Download \url{thinkstatsbook.com/survey.py}
  and run it in the same directory you put the data files in.  It
  should read the data files and print the number of lines in each:

\begin{verbatim}
Number of respondents 7643
Number of pregnancies 13593
\end{verbatim}

\item Browse the code to get a sense of what it does.  The next
section explains how it works.

\end{enumerate}

\end{ex}

\section{Tables and records}

The poet-philosopher Steve Martin once said:

\begin{quote}
``Oeuf'' means egg, ``chapeau'' means hat.  It's like those French
  have a different word for everything.
\end{quote}

Like the French, database programmers speak a slightly
different language, and since we're working with a database we need
to learn some vocabulary.

Each line in the respondents file contains information about one
respondent.  This information is called a {\bf record}.  The
variables that make up a record are called {\bf fields}.  A
collection of records is called a {\bf table}.

If you read {\tt survey.py} you will see class definitions for {\tt
  Record}, which is an object that represents a record, and {\tt
  Table}, which represents a table.

There are two subclasses of
{\tt Record}, {\tt Respondent} and {\tt Pregnancy}, which will
contain records from the respondent and pregnancy tables.
For the time being, these classes are empty; in particular, there
is no {\tt init} method to initialize their attributes.  Instead
we will use {\tt Table.MakeRecord} to convert a line of text into
a {\tt Record} object.

There are also two subclasses of {\tt Table}, {\tt Respondents}
and {\tt Pregnancies}.  The {\tt init} method in each class
specifies the default name of the data file and the type of
record to create.  Each {\tt Table} object has an attribute
named {\tt records}, which is a list of {\tt Record} objects.

For each {\tt Table}, the {\tt GetFields} method returns
a list of tuples that specify the fields from the record that
will be stored as attributes in each {\tt Record} object.

For example, here is {\tt Pregnancies.GetFields}:

\begin{verbatim}
    def GetFields(self):
        return [
            ('caseid', 1, 12, int),
            ('prglength', 275, 276, int),
            ('outcome', 277, 277, int),
            ('birthord', 278, 279, int),
            ('finalwgt', 423, 440, float),
            ]
\end{verbatim}

The elements of these tuples are:

\begin{description}

\item[field:] The name of the attribute where the field
will be stored.  Most of the time I use the names from the
NSFG codebook, converted to all lower case.

\item[start:] The index of the starting location for this
field.  You can look up these indices in the NSFG codebook
at \url{nsfg.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/WebDocs/NSFG/public/index.htm}.
For example, the indices for {\tt caseid} are
1--12.

\item[end:] The index of the ending location for this
field.

\item[conversion function:] A function that takes a string
and converts it to an appropriate type.  You can use built-in
functions like {\tt int} and {\tt float} or a user-defined
function.  If the conversion fails, the attribute gets the
string value {\tt 'NA'}.  If you don't want to convert a
field, you can provide an identity function or use {\tt str}.

\end{description}

For pregnancy records, we extract the following variables:

\begin{description}

\item[caseid] is the integer ID of the associated respondent.

\item[prglength] is the integer duration of the pregnancy in weeks.

\item[outcome] is an integer code for the outcome of the pregnancy.
The code 1 indicates a live birth.

\item[birthord] is the integer birth order of each live birth;
for example, the code for a first child is 1. 
For outcomes other than live birth, this field is blank.

\item[finalwgt] is the statistical weight associated with the respondent.
It is a floating-point value that indicates the number of people in
the U.S. population this respondent represents.  Members of undersampled
groups have higher weights.

\end{description}

If you read the casebook carefully, you will see that most of these
variables are {\bf recodes}, which means that they are not part
of the {\bf raw data} collected by the survey, but they are
calculated using the raw data.

For example, {\tt prglength} for live births is equal to the raw
variable {\tt wksgest} (weeks of gestation) if it is available;
otherwise it is estimated using {\tt mosgest * 4.33} (months of
gestation times the average number of weeks in a month).

Recodes are often based on logic that checks the consistency and
accuracy of the data.  In general it is a good idea to use recodes
unless there is a compelling reason to process the raw data
yourself.

\begin{ex}

In this exercise you will write a program to explore the data
in the Pregnancies table.

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the directory where you put {\tt survey.py} and the
data files, create a file named \verb"first.py" and
type or paste in the following code:

\begin{verbatim}
import survey
table = survey.Pregnancies()
table.ReadRecords()
print 'Number of pregnancies', len(table.records)
\end{verbatim}

The result should be 13593 pregnancies.

\item Write a loop that iterates \verb"table" and counts
the number of live births.  Find the documentation of {\tt outcome}
and confirm that your result is consistent with the summary
in the documentation.

\item Modify the loop to partition the live birth records into
two groups, one for first babies and one for the others.  Again,
read the documentation of {\tt birthord} to see if your results
are consistent.

When you are working with a new dataset, these kinds of checks
are useful for finding errors and inconsistencies in the data,
detecting bugs in your program, and checking your understanding
of the way the data are encoded.

\item Compute the average pregnancy length (in weeks) for first
babies and others.  Is there a difference between the groups?  How
big is it?

Note: For now we are ignoring the {\tt finalwgt} variable.

\end{enumerate}

You can download a solution to this exercise from
\url{thinkstatsbook.com/first.py}.

\end{ex}

\section{Significance}

In the previous exercise, you compared the gestation
period for first babies and others, and if things worked out,
you found that first babies are born about 13 hours later,
on average.

A difference like that is called an {\bf apparent effect};
that is, there might be something going on, but we are not
yet sure.  There are several questions we still want to ask:

\begin{itemize}

\item If the two groups have different means, what about other {\bf
  summary statistics}, like median and variance?  Can we be more
  precise about how the groups differ?

\item Is it possible that the difference we saw could occur by chance,
  even if the groups we compared were actually the same?  If so,
  we would conclude that the effect was not {\bf statistically
    significant}.

\item Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to sample bias or
  some other error in the experimental setup?  If so, then we might
  conclude that the effect is an {\bf artefact}; that is, something we
  created (by accident) rather than found. 

\end{itemize}

We will address these questions in the next few chapters.

\end{description}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{ex}

The best way to learn about statistics is to work on a project you are
interested in.  Is there a question like, ``Do first babies arrive
late,'' that you would like to investigate?

Think about questions you find personally interesting, or items of
conventional wisdom, or controversial topics, or questions that have
political consequences, and see if you can formulate a question that
lends itself to statistical inquiry.

Now start looking for data to help you address the
question.  Governments are good sources because data from
public research is often freely available\footnote{On the day
I wrote this paragraph, a court in the UK ruled that the
Freedom of Information Act applies to scientific research data.}.

Another way to find data is Wolfram Alpha, which is a curated
collection of good-quality datasets at \url{wolframalpha.com}.
Results from Wolfram Alpha are subject to copyright
restrictions; you might want to check the terms before you commit
yourself.

Google and other search engines can also help you find data, but it
can be harder to evaluate the quality of resources on the web.

If it seems like someone has answered your question, look closely to
see whether the answer is justified.  There might be flaws in the data
or the analysis that make the conclusion unreliable.  In that case you
could perform a different analysis of the same data, or look for a
better source of data.

If you find a published paper that addresses your question, you
should be able to get the raw data.  Many authors make their data
available on the web, but for sensitive data you might have to
write to the authors, provide information about how you plan to use
the data, or agree to certain terms of use.  Be persistent!

\end{ex}


\chapter{Descriptive statistics}

\section{Means and averages}

In the previous chapter, I mentioned three summary statistics---mean,
variance and median---without explaining what they are.  So before
we go any farther, let's take care of that.

If you have a sample of $n$ values, $x_i$, the mean, $\mu$, is
the sum of the values divided by the number of values; in other words

\[ \mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i \]

\begin{ex}
For the exercises in this chapter, create two file:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt thinkstats.py}]: This file will contain general-purpose
functions we will use throughout the book.

\item[{\tt descriptive.py}]: This file will contain code specific
to the exercises in this chapter.

\end{description}

In {\tt thinkstats.py} write a Python function named {\tt Mean} that
takes a sequence of numbers and returns their mean.  Hint: the result
should be a floating-point value even if the numbers are integers.

In {\tt descriptive.py} write code that tests {\tt Mean}.
\end{ex}

The words ``mean'' and ``average'' are sometimes used interchangeably,
but I will maintain this distinction:

\begin{itemize}

\item The ``mean'' of a sample is the summary statistic computed with
  the previous formula.

\item An ``average'' is one of many summary statistics you might
  choose to describe the typical value, or the expected value, or the
  {\bf central tendency} of a sample.  

\end{itemize}

Sometimes the mean is a good description of a set of values.  For
example, apples are all pretty much the same size (at least the ones
sold in supermarkets).  So if I buy 6 apples and the total weight is 3
pounds, it would be a reasonable summary to say they are about a half
pound each.

But pumpkins are more diverse.  Suppose I grow several varieties in my
garden, and one day I harvest three decorative pumpkins that are 1
pound each, two pie pumpkins that are 3 pounds each, and one Atlantic
Giant\textregistered~pumpkin that weighs 591 pounds.  The mean of
this sample is 100 pounds, but if I told you ``The average pumpkin
in my garden is 100 pounds,'' that would be wrong, or at least
misleading.

In this example, there is no meaningful average because
there is no typical pumpkin.

\section{Variance}

If there is no single number that summarizes pumpkin weights,
we can do a little better with two numbers: mean and {\bf variance}.

In the same way that the mean is intended to describe the central
tendency, variance is intended to describe the ``spread''.
The variance of a set of values is

\[ \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i (x_i - \mu)^2 \]

The term $x_i - \mu$ is called the ``deviation from the mean,'' so
variance is the mean squared deviation, which is why it is denoted
$\sigma^2$.  The square root of variance, $\sigma$, is called the {\bf
  standard deviation}.

\begin{ex}
In {\tt thinkstats.py} write a function named {\tt Var} that takes a
sequence of numbers and returns their variance.

In {\tt descriptive.py} write code that
computes the variance of the pumpkin data.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Reusing code from {\tt survey.py} and {\tt first.py}, compute the
variance of gestation time for first babies and others.  Does it look
like the spread is the same for the two groups?
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Compute the standard deviation of the pooled data (first babies
and others).  How big is the difference between the
means compared to the standard deviation?  What does this comparison
suggest about the statistical significance of the difference?
\end{ex}

If you have prior experience, you might have seen a 
formula for variance with $n-1$ in the denominator, rather than $n$.
This statistic is called the ``sample variance,'' and it is used
to estimate the variance in a population using a sample.  We will
come back to this when we talk about estimation.

\section{Distributions}

Summary statistics are concise, but dangerous, because they obscure
the data.  An alternative is to look at the {\bf distribution} of the
data, which describes how often each value appears.

The most common representation of a distribution is a {\bf histogram},
which is a graph that shows the frequency or probability
of each value.  

In this context, {\bf frequency} means the number of times a value
appears in a dataset---it has nothing to do with the pitch of a sound
or tuning of a radio signal.  A {\bf probability} is a frequency expressed
as a fraction of the sample size, $n$.

In Python, an efficient way to compute frequencies is with a dictionary.
Given a sequence of values, $t$:

\begin{verbatim}
hist = {}
for x in t:
    hist[x] = hist.get(x, 0) + 1
\end{verbatim}

So {\tt hist} is a dictionary that maps from values to frequencies.
To get from frequencies to probabilities, we divide through by $n$,
which is called {\bf normalization}:

\begin{verbatim}
n = float(len(t))
pmf = {}
for x, freq in hist.items():
    pmf[x] = hist[x] / n
\end{verbatim}

The normalized histogram is called a {\bf pmf}, which stands for
``probability mass function;''  that is, it's a function that
maps from values to probabilities (I'll explain ``mass'' later).

It might be confusing to call a Python dictionary a function.  In
mathematics, a function is a mapping from one set of values to
another.  In Python, we {\em usually} represent mathematical functions
with function objects, but in this case we are using a dictionary
(which is also called a ``map,'' if that helps).

\begin{ex}
Create a file named {\tt Pmf.py} and write a definition for a class
named {\tt Hist} that represents a histogram with a dictionary
that maps from values to frequencies.

Write a function named {\tt MakeHist} that takes a sequence of
values and returns a Hist object.

Write a method named {\tt Freq} that takes a value and returns
the corresponding frequency, or 0
if the value hasn't appeared.  Write tests for your code.
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}
In {\tt Pmf.py}, write a definition for a class named {\tt Pmf} that
represents a probability mass function with a dictionary that maps
from values to probabilities.

Write a function called {\tt MakePmf} that takes a sequence of
values and returns their pmf.

Write a method called {\tt Prob} that
takes a value and returns the corresponding probability, or 0
if the value has frequency 0.  Write tests to test your code.
\end{ex}


\section{Plotting histograms}

There are a number of Python packages for making figures and graphs.
The one I will use in the book is {\tt pyplot}, which is part of
the {\tt matplotlib} package at \url{matplotlib.sourceforge.net}.

This package is included in many Python installations.  To see whether
you have it, launch the Python interpreter and run:

\begin{verbatim}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.pie([1,2,3])
plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

If you have {\tt matplotlib} you should see a simple pie chart;
otherwise you will have to install it.

The {\tt import...as} statement lets you import a package and give
it a nickname, which is convenient if the name of the package is long.
I will use the nickname {\tt plt} to be consistent with the examples
in the {\tt pyplot} documentation.

Histograms and pmfs are most often plotted as bar charts.  The
{\tt pyplot} function to draw a bar chart is {\tt bar}.

The following figure shows histograms of the pregnancy lengths for
first babies and others.

\beforefig
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{code/nsfg_hist.eps}}
\afterfig

Histograms are useful because they make the following features immediately
apparent:

\begin{description}

\item[Mode:]  The most obvious feature of this distribution is the large
number of values at 39 weeks.  The most common value in a distribution is
called the {\bf mode}.  In this case, the mode is the summary statistic
that does the best job of describing the typical value.

\item[Shape:] Around the mode, the distribution is asymmetric; it drops
off quickly to the right and more slowly to the left.  From a medical
point of view, this makes sense.  Babies are often born early, but
seldom later than 42 weeks.  Also, the right side of the distribution is
probably truncated because doctors often intervene after 42 weeks.

\item[Outliers:] Values far from the mode are called {\bf outliers}.
Some of these are just unusual cases, like babies born at 30 weeks.
But many of them are probably due to errors, either in the reporting
or recording of data.

\end{description}

Although histograms make some features apparent, they are usually not
useful for comparing two distributions.  In this example, there are
fewer ``first babies'' than ``others,'' so some of the apparent
differences in the histograms are due to sample sizes.


\section{Plotting PMFs}

We can solve that problem by normalizing the distributions---that
is, dividing through by the sample sizes---to generate the PMFs:

\beforefig
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{code/nsfg_pmf.eps}}
\afterfig

Using the PMF, we can see more clearly where the distributions
differ.  First babies seem to be less likely to arrive on time
(week 39) and more likely to be a little late (weeks 41 and 42).

\begin{ex}
Create a file named {\tt plot.py} and write a function called {\tt
  Hist} that takes a Hist object and generates a bar chart using {\tt
  pyplot.bar}.  This function should also work for Pmf objects.

Write another function called {\tt Hists} that takes two Hists (or Pmfs)
and generates side-by-side histograms like the figures in this
section.  You will have to read the {\tt pyplot} documentation to
adjust the width and position of the bars.

Use the data from the NSFG to generate plots like the ones in this
section.
\end{ex}


\section{Outliers}

Outliers are values that are far from the mode.  Outliers might
be caused by errors in collecting or processing the data, or
they might be legitimate, if unusual, measurements.

It is always a good idea to check for outliers, and sometimes
it is useful, and appropriate, to discard them.

In the list of pregnancy lengths for live births, the 10 lowest values are

\begin{verbatim}
weeks  count
0      1
4      1
9      1
13     1
17     2
18     1
19     1
20     1
21     2
22     7
\end{verbatim}

Values below 20 weeks are certainly errors, and values higher than 30
weeks are probably legitimate.  But there are a non-negligible number of
values in between that are hard to interpret.

On the other end, the 10 highest values are

\begin{verbatim}
weeks  count
40     1116
41     587
42     328
43     148
44     46
45     10
46     1
47     1
48     7
50     2
\end{verbatim}

Again, there are some values here that are almost certainly errors, but
it is hard to know for sure.

Correcting other errors (like the bump at 35 weeks)?
   (use birth weight?)

Trimmed mean and variance.

Don't get carried away.


\section{Other visualizations}

Histograms and PMFs are useful for exploratory data analysis;
once you have an idea what is going on, it is often useful to
design a visualization that focuses on the apparent effect.

In the NSFG data, the biggest differences in the distributions are
near the mode.  So it makes sense to zoom in on that part of the
graph, and to transform the data to emphasize differences.

The following figure shows the difference between the PMFs for weeks
35-45.  I multiplied by 100 to express the differences in percentage
points.

\beforefig
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{code/nsfg_ratios.eps}}
\afterfig

This figure makes the pattern clearer: first babies are
less likely to be born in week 39, and somewhat more likely
to be born in weeks 41 and 42.


\section{Relative risk}

We started with the question, ``Do first babies arrive late?''  To
make that more precise, let's say that a baby is early if it is born
during Week 37 or earlier, on time if it is born during Week 38, 39 or
40, and late if it is born during Week 41 or later.  Ranges like these
that are used to group data are called {\bf buckets}.

\begin{ex}

Create a file named {\tt risk.py}.
Write functions named {\tt ProbEarly}, {\tt ProbOnTime} and
{\tt ProbLate} that take a PMF and compute the fraction of births
that fall into each bucket.  Hint: write a generalized function
that these functions call.

Make three PMFs, one for first babies, one for others, and one for
all live births.  For each PMF, compute the probability of being
born early, on time, or late.

One way to summarize data like this is with a {\bf relative risk},
which is a ratio of two probabilities.  For example, the probability
that a first baby is born early is 18.2\%.  For other babies it is
16.8\%, so the relative risk is 1.08.  That means that first babies
are about 8\% more likely to be early.

Write code to confirm those results, then compute the relative risks of
being born on time and being late.

\end{ex}


\section{Conditional probability}

Imagine that someone you know is pregnant, and it is the beginning of
Week 39.  What is the chance that the baby will be born in the next
week?  How much does the answer change if it's a first baby?

We can answer these questions by computing a {\bf conditional
probability}, which is (ahem!) a probability that depends on a condition.
In this case, the condition is that we know the baby didn't arrive
during Weeks 0--38.

Here's one way to do it:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Given a PMF, generate a fake cohort of 1000 pregnancies.
For each number of weeks, $x$, the number of pregnancies with
duration $x$ is $1000 PMF(x)$.

\item Remove from the cohort all pregnancies with length less than 39.

\item Compute the PMF of the remaining durations; the result is the
conditional PMF.

\item Evaluate the conditional PMF at $x = 39$ weeks.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{ex}
Create a file named {\tt conditional.py}.
Write a program that implements this algorithm and computes the
probability that a baby will be born during Week 39, given that
it was not born prior to Week 39.

Generalize this program to compute the
probability that a baby will be born during Week $x$, given that
it was not born prior to Week $x$, for all $x$.

Plot this value as a function of $x$ for first babies and others.

\end{ex}


\section{Reporting results}

At this point we have explored the data and seen several apparent
effects.  For now, let's assume that these effects are real (but let's
remember that it is an assumption).  How should we report these
results?

The answer might depend on who is asking the question.  For example,
a scientist might be interested in any (real) effect, no matter how
small.  A doctor might only care about effects that are
{\bf clinically significant}; that is, differences that make a difference.
A pregnant woman might be interested in results that are relevant to
her, like the conditional probabilities in the previous section.

How you report results might also depend on your goals.  If you are
trying to demonstrate the significance of an effect, you might choose
summary statistics, like relative risk, that emphasize differences.
If you are trying to reassure a patient, you might choose statistics
that put the differences in context.

\begin{ex}

Based on the results from the previous exercises, suppose you were
asked to summarize what you learned about whether first
babies arrive late.

Which summary statistics would you use if you wanted to get a story
on the evening news?  Which ones would you use if you wanted to
reassure an anxious patient?

Finally, imagine that you are Cecil Adams, author of {\it The Straight
  Dope} (\url{straightdope.com}), and your job is to answer the
question, ``Do first babies arrive late?''  Write a paragraph that
uses your results to answer this question clearly, precisely, and
accurately.

\end{ex}

\section{Percentiles}

If you have ever taken a standardized test, you probably got your
results in the form of a raw score and a {\bf percentile rank}.
In this context, the percentile rank is the fraction of people who
scored lower than you (or the same).  So if you are ``in the 90th
percentile,'' you did as well as or better than 90\% of the people who
took the exam (congratulations!).

If you had a sequence of test scores, {\tt scores},
and a particular value, \verb"your_score", you could compute
your percentile rank like this:

\begin{verbatim}
def PercentileRank(scores, your_score):
    count = 0
    for score in scores:
        if score <= your_score:
            count += 1

    percentile_rank = 100.0 * count / len(scores)
    return percentile_rank
\end{verbatim}
%
% see score_example.py
%
For example, if the scores were 55, 66, 77, 88 and 99, and you got
the 88, then your percentile rank is {\tt 100 * 4 / 5} which is 80.

If you are given a value, it is easy to find its percentile rank; going
the other way is slightly harder.  If you are given a percentile rank
and you want to find the corresponding value, one option is to
sort the values and search for the one you want:

\begin{verbatim}
def Percentile(scores, percentile_rank):
    scores.sort()
    for score in scores:
        if PercentileRank(scores, score) >= percentile_rank:
            return score
\end{verbatim}

The result of this calculation is a {\bf percentile}.  For example,
the 50th percentile is the value with percentile rank 50.  In the
distribution of exam scores, the 50th percentile is 77.

\begin{ex}
This implementation of {\tt Percentile} is not very efficient.  A
better approach is to use the percentile rank to compute the index
of the element.  Write a version of the function that uses this
approach.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
If you only want to compute one percentile, it is not efficient
to sort the scores.  A better option is the selection algorithm,
which you can read about at \url{wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm}.

Write (or find) an implementation of the selection algorithm and use
it to write an efficient version of {\tt Percentile}.
\end{ex}


\section{Cumulative distribution functions}

Now that we understand percentiles, we are ready to tackle the
cumulative distribution function (CDF).  The CDF is the function that
maps values to their percentile rank in a distribution.

The CDF is a function of $x$, where $x$ is any value that might appear
in the distribution.  To evaluate $CDF(x)$ for a particular value of
$x$, we compute the fraction of the values in the sample less than (or
equal to) $x$.

Here's what that looks like as a Python function that takes
a sample, {\tt t}, and a value, {\tt x}:

\begin{verbatim}
def Cdf(t, x):
    count = 0.0
    for value in t:
        if value <= x:
            count += 1.0

    return count / len(t)
\end{verbatim}

This function should look familiar; it is almost identical to {\tt
  PercentileRank}.  The CDF is the function that maps values to their
percentile rank (in the range 0-100) or, more often, their
cumulative probability (in the range 0-1).

As an example, suppose a sample has the values ${1, 2, 2, 3, 5}$.
Here are some values from its CDF:

\begin{eqnarray*}
CDF(0) &=& 0    \\
CDF(1) &=& 0.2    \\
CDF(2) &=& 0.6    \\
CDF(3) &=& 0.8    \\
CDF(4) &=& 0.8    \\
CDF(5) &=& 1    \\
\end{eqnarray*}
%
Notice that we can evaluate the CDF for any value of $x$, not just
values that appear in the sample.
If $x$ is less than the smallest value in the sample, $CDF(x)$ is 0.
If $x$ is greater than the largest value, $CDF(x)$ is 1.

Here is a graphical representation of this CDF.

\beforefig
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{code/example_cdf.eps}}
\afterfig

The function {\tt Cdf} above is efficient enough if we only want
to evaluate the CDF at one point.  But there are several operations
we might want to perform on CDFs:

\begin{description}

\item[Evaluate:] Given a value $x$, evaluate $CDF(x)$ to get a
probability $p$.  We can use this operation to compute percentile
ranks.

\item[Invert:] Given a probability $p$, find
the value $x$ so that $CDF(x) = p$.  We can use this operation
to compute percentiles.

\item[Render:] Generate a sequence of points suitable for plotting
the CDF.

\end{description}

It is not obvious what data structures we should use to implement
these operations; there are several reasonable choices.  In the
following exercise I recommend an option that is simple and efficient
(enough).

\begin{ex}
Create a file named {\tt Cdf.py} and write a definition for a class
named {\tt Cdf} that represents a CDF.  The attributes of a Cdf
object are {\tt xs}, which is a sorted list of the unique values
in the sample, and {\tt ps} which is a list of probabilities that
correspond to the values in {\tt xs}.

Write a simple constructor that takes {\tt xs} and {\tt ps} as
parameters, then write two factory functions:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt MakeCdfFromDict}]: Takes a dictionary that maps from
values to frequencies, computes {\tt xs} and {\tt ps}, and returns
a {\tt Cdf} object.

\item[{\tt MakeCdfFromList}]: Takes a sequence of values, makes
a dictionary that maps from values to frequencies, and uses
{\tt MakeCdfFromDict} to make and return a {\tt Cdf} object.

\end{description}

Now write the following methods for {\tt Cdf}:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt Prob}]: Given a value $x$, compute the probability $p = CDF(x)$.

\item[{\tt Value}]: Given a probability $p$, compute the
corresponding value, $x$; that is, the inverse CDF of $p$.

\item[{\tt Render}]: Return two lists, {\tt xs} and {\tt ps}, suitable
for plotting the CDF.  Notice that the CDF is a step function, so these
lists should have two elements for each unique value in the distribution.

\end{description}

Test your code by computing the CDF of the values ${1, 2, 2, 3, 5}$.
Test {\tt Prob} and {\tt Value} using the examples in this section.

Write a function that plots the CDF with the {\tt pyplot} function
{\tt plot}.  Confirm that your plot looks like the figure above.

\url{thinkstatsbook.com/cdf_test.py}.  You can download a solution

\section{Back to the survey data}

The following figure shows the CDFs of pregnancy length
for first babies and others in the NSFG dataset.

\beforefig
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{code/nsfg_cdf.eps}}
\afterfig

This figure makes apparent where the difference between the
distributions is greatest: in weeks 40, 41, and 42.  Except for these
three weeks, the distributions are almost identical.

Specifically, first babies seem less likely to arrive after 39
weeks, and slightly more likely to arrive before.  Remember that
the mean gestation period for first babies is slightly higher,
so this is the {\tt opposite} of the effect we expected!

How can that be?  If first babies are less likely to be born late,
how can the mean be greater?
